# RNNoise Demo - AI-Powered Noise Cancellation

A Next.js demo application showcasing real-time noise cancellation using the RNNoise neural network via WebAssembly.

## Features

- üé§ **Real-time Audio Recording** with microphone access
- üéµ **Live Audio Visualization** for both original and processed audio
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Noise Cancellation** using RNNoise neural network
- üîä **Side-by-Side Audio Comparison** between original and processed audio
- üìÅ **Audio Download** functionality for both versions
- üì± **Responsive Design** that works on desktop and mobile

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **@timephy/rnnoise-wasm** for noise cancellation
- **Web Audio API** for real-time audio processing
- **WebAssembly** for high-performance audio processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- A modern web browser with microphone support
- HTTPS connection (required for microphone access)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Usage

1. **Record Audio**: Click "Start Recording" and allow microphone access
2. **Watch Visualizations**: See real-time audio waveforms for both original and processed audio
3. **Stop Recording**: Click "Stop Recording" when finished
4. **Compare Audio**: Switch to the "Compare Audio" tab to hear the difference
5. **Download**: Save both original and processed audio files

## How RNNoise Works

RNNoise is a recurrent neural network developed by Mozilla that:

- Analyzes audio in 480-sample frames (10ms at 48kHz)
- Uses machine learning to distinguish speech from noise
- Provides superior noise reduction compared to traditional methods
- Runs entirely in the browser via WebAssembly

## Demo Tips

For the best demonstration:

- Use headphones to avoid feedback
- Record in a noisy environment (fan, traffic, background chatter)
- Speak clearly during recording
- Compare the original vs processed audio carefully
- Try different types of background noise

## Technical Details

- **Sample Rate**: 48kHz
- **Frame Size**: 480 samples (10ms)
- **Processing**: Real-time with minimal latency
- **Output Format**: WAV for processed audio, WebM for original

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 66+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 11.1+
- Edge 79+

Note: Requires HTTPS for microphone access in production.

## Development
